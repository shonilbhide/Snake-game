# Snake Game with Enhanced Moves

## Gameplay

In this Snake Game, you control a snake on the game board, and your objective is to eat as much food as possible. As you consume food, the snake grows longer, making the game more challenging. Be careful not to run into the walls or collide with yourself, as this will end the game.
